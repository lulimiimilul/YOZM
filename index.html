        Man
        This happened one, two, three times too much
        These dumb-ass niggas
        Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
        All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
        Look at what you did, listen to your friends
        When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
        Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
        All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
        Look at what you did, listen to your friends
        When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
        You can say that again
        Niggas is square like Madison
        I can't even really get mad at them
        They fall, then I gotta facepalm
        Shook him like an 8-ball and it's embarrassing
        Ten-page text, should've wrote a book, could've made a bag
        But he broke and he still waiting 'til I can chill
        And he really think I'ma get back to him
        Doing too much, relax a bit
        Acting like that 'cause your dad's a bitch
        Must be the way that the planets is
        Must be your face 'cause it's not your dick
        I'm a freak, not a masochist
        Should've known you had the baddest bitch
        Left on read and can't give head
        Really, you ain't shit, need a laxative
        Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
        All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
        Look at what you did, listen to your friends
        When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
        Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
        All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
        Look at what you did, listen to your friends
        When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
        Said that's not cheating if I wasn't with your ass, yo
        You kept secrets and your cousin told me that, so (your cousin)
        Logical thinking is just something that you lack, so
        What you even mad for? Looking like a stick up in your asshole
        I'm not your mommy, nigga, find a new hobby, nigga
        Return, yo, 'fore I get picked up, your shit's in the lobby, nigga
        I'm not gon' key your car, I'll call your fucking mom
        You should have paid my rent, go get a fucking job
        Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
        All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
        Look at what you did, listen to your friends
        When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
        Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
        All up in your fridge, can't pay rent

    <b>â™ª Good Ones_Charli XCX â™ª</b>
      I wish you gave me a reason
      That you were better at leavin'
      That you got your kicks from seeing me low
      I always let the good ones go
      Don't want the kisses, unless they're bitter
      I'm hooked on touches that leave me weaker
      I swear that I love nothing more than broke
      I always let the good ones go
      And baby, you couldn't have loved me any better
      But doin' this is all that I've known ever
      I want the bad ones, 'cause they're all I know
      I always let the good ones go
      I always let the go, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-
      I let the good ones go, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-
      I let the good ones (go)
      Let you down easy, I'm trying
      'Cause you're everything I've spent my whole life fighting
      So when I walk away, it's not your fault
      I always let the good ones (ones), go (go)
      And baby, you couldn't have loved me any better
      But doin' this is all that I've known ever
      I want the bad ones, 'cause they're all I know
      I always let the good ones go
      I always let the good ones go, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh- (oh, oh)
      I let the good ones go, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh- (yeah, yeah)
      I let the good ones go, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-
      (And baby you couldn't have loved me any better, better, better)
      I let the good ones go, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-
      (But doin' this is all that I've known ever, ever, ever)
      I let the good ones go

    <b>â™ª Save Your Tears_The Weeknd â™ª</b>
      Ooh
      Na-na, yeah
      I saw you dancing in a crowded room
      You look so happy when I'm not with you
      But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
      A single teardrop falling from your eye
      I don't know why I run away
      I'll make you cry when I run away
      You could've asked me why I broke your heart
      You could've told me that you fell apart
      But you walked past me like I wasn't there
      And just pretended like you didn't care
      I don't know why I run away
      I'll make you cry when I run away
      Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
      Save your tears for another
      Save your tears for another day
      Save your tears for another day
      So, I made you think that I would always stay
      I said some things that I should never say
      Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
      And now you won't love me for a second time
      I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
      Said I'll make you cry when I run away
      Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
      Save your tears for another
      I realize that I'm much too late
      And you deserve someone better
      Save your tears for another day (ooh, yeah)
      Save your tears for another day (yeah)
      I don't know why I run away
      I'll make you cry when I run away
      Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl (ah)
      I said save your tears for another day (ah)
      Save your tears for another day (ah)
      Save your tears for another day (ah)
